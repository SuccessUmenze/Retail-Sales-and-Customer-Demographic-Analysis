# Retail-Sales-and-Customer-Demographic-Analysis
# OVERVIEW
This project analyzes retail transaction data to uncover customer purchasing behavior, revenue drivers, and sales trends across age groups, gender, product categories, and time.

The project demonstrates how Power Query and Power BI can be used to clean raw data, model it, and deliver decision-ready insights through an interactive dashboard.
# DATA SOURCE
This project is based on a synthetic retail sales dataset created to simulate real-world retail transactions for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# BUSINESS PROBLEM

Retail teams often struggle to transform raw sales data into clear, actionable insights needed for effective decision-making. As a result, they lack visibility into key areas such as customer value, product performance, and sales trends.

Specifically, business stakeholders need to understand:
- Which customer segments generate the highest revenue

- Which products and categories perform best across different demographics

- When sales peak or decline across time periods

This project uses demographic and transactional data analysis to address these gaps and support data-driven retail strategy.
Project Objectives

Analyze retail sales performance across multiple dimensions

Identify high-value customer demographics

Track monthly revenue trends and sales seasonality

Compare product categories by quantity sold and average price

Build an interactive dashboard for easy decision-making
  
# TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES

- Microsoft Excel

- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

- Excel formulas (SUM, IF, AVERGE, COUNT)

- Slicers for interactive filtering

# EXCEL FOR DATA FORMATTING & PRE-PROCESSING

Excel was used as the sole tool for data preparation and analysis.

Key steps included:

Cleaning missing values and removing duplicates

Formatting numeric fields (sales amount, quantity, price)

Standardizing column names and categories

Creating calculated columns (e.g., price per unit, age groups)

Preparing structured tables for Pivot Table analysis
