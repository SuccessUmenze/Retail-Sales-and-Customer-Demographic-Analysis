# Retail-Sales-and-Customer-Demographic-Analysis
## OVERVIEW
This project analyzes retail transaction data to uncover customer purchasing behavior, revenue drivers, and sales trends across age groups, gender, product categories, and time.

The project demonstrates how Excel (formulas, Pivot Tables/Charts, Shapes, Slicers, etc.) can be used to clean raw data, model it, and deliver decision-ready insights through an interactive dashboard.
## DATA SOURCE
This project is based on a synthetic retail sales dataset created to simulate real-world retail transactions for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## BUSSINESS PROBLEM
Retail teams often struggle to turn raw sales data into clear insights, making it difficult to understand customer value, product performance, and sales trends. This project analyzes retail sales and customer demographics to identify high-value customers, top-performing products, and seasonal sales patterns, supporting better data-driven decision-making.

## BUSINESS QUESTIONS & KPIs
- Which month recorded the highest sales and order volume?
- Which product categories generate the highest total sales?
- Which product categories have the highest number of transactions?
- Which age groups contribute the most to overall sales?
- How does purchasing behavior differ between male and female customers?
- What is the average spend per transaction across product categories?
- How does transaction size (quantity purchased) affect total sales?
- How do product prices vary across different product categories?
  
## TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
- Excel formulas (SUM, IF, AVERGE, COUNT)
- Slicers for interactive filtering

## EXCEL FOR DATA FORMATTING & PRE-PROCESSING
Excel was used as the sole tool for data preparation and analysis.
### Key steps included:
- Cleaning missing values and removing duplicates
- Formatting numeric fields (sales amount, quantity, price)
- Standardizing column names and categories
- Creating calculated columns (age groups) and KPIs at the top  of the dashboard with Excel formulas (Total Amount,
- Preparing structured tables for Pivot Table analysis
- Merge all Pivot tables charts into one dashboard with use of shapes, textbox and applied slicers to make the dynamic.

## PROJECT INSIGHT
- Customer purchasing behavior varies noticeably across **age groups and gender**, showing that demographics play a meaningful role in sales performance.
- Sales analysis over time reveals **clear fluctuations across months**, highlighting periods of higher and lower sales activity that indicate seasonality.
- Certain **product categories consistently outperform others** in both revenue and quantity sold, making them key drivers of overall sales performance.
- Average spending differs across customer age groups, suggesting **distinct purchasing patterns and product preferences** among different demographics.
- Transaction analysis shows variation in **order size**, indicating that customers buying more items per transaction contribute differently to total revenue.
- Price distribution across product categories reveals **concentration around specific price ranges**, helping identify where customer demand is strongest.
- The interactive Excel dashboard enables quick comparison across **demographics, product categories, and time periods**, making it easier for stakeholders to explore trends and answer business questions without manual analysis.

## CONCLUSION & BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT SUMMARY

To improve retail performance, the business should focus on aligning product offerings, pricing, and marketing strategies with customer demographics and purchasing patterns. By prioritizing high-performing product categories, tailoring campaigns to key age and gender segments, and planning inventory around seasonal sales trends, the business can drive more efficient sales growth. Strengthening transaction-level strategies such as bundling and quantity-based promotions can further increase average order value, while ongoing monitoring through an interactive dashboard ensures decisions remain data-driven and responsive to changing customer behavior.
